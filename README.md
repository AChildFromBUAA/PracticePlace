# PracticePlace
This is my practice place for iOS. I use this repository to practice all I learned about iOS skills.
## What's inside
* a simple example of NSNotification
* a simple use of UIPageViewController(like a dictionary)
* a simple use of webView...(2333)
* a simple example of Settings.bundle
* ...

## A funny thing to say
I use a Tab Bar Controller to make all my practice saved and showed.
